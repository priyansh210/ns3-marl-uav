 * AgentApplication needs to add the according interfaces with \c AddObservationInterface(),
 * \c AddRewardInterface(), \c AddActionInterface() or \c AddAgentInterface(). When an observation
 * or a reward is received, the AgentApplication stores it in a data structure and calls
 * \c OnRecvObs() resp. \c OnRecvReward() with the ID of the interface the observation or reward was
 * received from. The AgentApplication needs to implement \c OnRecvObs() and \c OnRecvReward() to
 * handle received observations and rewards.
